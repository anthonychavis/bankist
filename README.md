## Introduction

<!-- The goal of the project was primarily to practice javascript functionality. -->

I did not want to play much with the appearance of this project. Instead, I paid more attention to how a more experienced engineer structured the HTML & CSS files & web page. I also want to push through projects to play more with APIs, including creating projects myself.

## Technologies

-   JavaScript - ES6+
-   CSS3
-   HTML5

## Launch

[Financial Institution site](https://anthonychavis.github.io/bankist/)
