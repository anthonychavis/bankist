## Introduction

The goal of the project was primarily to practice javascript functionality. In addition, I practiced making a flowchart using the draw.io application.

I did not want to play much with the appearance of this project. Instead, I paid more attention to how a more experienced engineer structured the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. I also want to push through projects to play more with APIs, including creating projects myself.

<!-- accounts & login: js: 1111, jd: 2222, stw: 3333, ss: 4444.
A transfer will appear as activity on the account of both the sender and receiver (as long as you don't refresh the browser tab you can login to the receiver's account to check)
Loan will be approved if a deposit is greater than 10% the request(10% of the request must be less than a prior deposit.
 -->

## Technologies

-   JavaScript - ES6+
-   CSS3
-   HTML5

## Login

There are two accounts to log in to. The first account's username is "js" with the password "1111". The second has username "jd" with password "2222". Once logged in, you can transfer money back and forth between the two accounts. However, you will notice a 1:1 exchange rate despite a difference in currency. There is no logout button; log in to the other account while still logged into the current. You can also request a loan and close the account altogether. Lastly, there is a logout timer to log you out after inactivity.
